#### Add rights information

1.  Go go the SIP detail panel and click "Add" under "Rights"

2.  Open the RAC PREMIS Statements (Responses) spreadsheet. Each SIP should correspond with one Collection/Project Name

3.  Copy rights information from the RAC PREMIS Statements (Responses)
    > spreadsheet.

    a.  For processed born digital materials, each SIP will generally have three rights statements: Copyright, Donor, and Policy.

        i.  Copyright

            1.  Choose "Copyright" from the drop down menu

            2.  Fill out all fields except for the three "Copyright documentation identifier" fields.

            3.  On the next page, fill out all fields. If the Rights Statement spreadsheet has "Open" for "Term of grant end date," leave the "End" field blank but check the
                > "Open End Date" box.

            4.  Click "Done"

        ii. Donor

            1.  Choose "Donor" from the drop down menu

            2.  Fill out all fields except for the "Donor documentation identifier" and "Donor agreement note" fields. The donor agreement dates are the same as the "Term of grant" start and end dates in the spreadsheet.

            3.  On the next page, fill out all fields. If the Rights Statement spreadsheet has "Open" for "Term of grant end date," leave the "End" field blank but check the
                > "Open End Date" box.

            4.  Click "Done"

        iii. Policy

            1.  Choose "Policy" from the drop down menu

            2.  On the first screen, leave all fields blank

            3.  On the next page, fill out all fields. If the Rights Statement spreadsheet has "Open" for "Term of grant end date," leave the "End" field blank but check the
                > "Open End Date" box.

            4.  Click "Done"

    b.  Repeat this step for each type of rights statement.
