The purpose of this guide is to detail the Archivematica Ingest workflow for processed born digital materials. Processed digital materials are digital objects that have been described in a finding aid.


## Step 1: Export files & group into SIPs


### ArchivesSpace DIP Upload Administrative Settings

-   ArchivesSpace host, backend port, administrative user, password, URL prefix, and repository number will generally not change

-   Restrictions apply should be set to "base on PREMIS"

-   XLink Actuate - on request

-   XLink show - embed

-   Use statement: must be from controlled list in ArchivesSpace

-   Object type: must be from controlled list in ArchivesSpace

-   Conditions governing access:

-   Conditions governing use:

### PREMIS Agent

This should be:

Agent Identifier Value: NNttR

Agent Name: Rockefeller Archive Center

Step 4: Transfer to Archivematica & create SIP
==============================================

Overview
--------

The ingest of files through Archivematica into our storage system involves several steps. The first step is the Transfer process, which transforms any set of digital objects and/or directories into a SIP
(Submission Information Package). In the Transfer tab of the Dashboard,
the user selects digital objects from Staging (Y: drive 192.168.50.42)
to copy into Archivematica. Once uploaded to the dashboard, transfers run through several micro-services:

-   UUID assignment, checksum verification (if checksums are present)

-   package extraction (i.e. unzipping of zipped or otherwise packaged files)

-   virus checking

-   indexing

-   format identification and validation; and metadata extraction.

At the end of transfer, the user creates a SIP from one or more transfer(s). Once this is done, the SIP is moved into ingest.

This work primarily takes place in the "transfer" tab

Note: Once this process begins, you cannot go back to earlier stages and reconfigure ingest options. The system will pause at certain decision-making points and prompt for input prior to continuing. Itâ€™s best to be prepared for the entire process at the start, for example,
know if normalization is required, have rights statements prepared, etc.
